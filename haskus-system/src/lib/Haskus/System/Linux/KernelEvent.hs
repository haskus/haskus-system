-- | Parse a kernel event
--
-- Kernel events are received as several zero-terminal strings. The first line
-- isn't very useful because it is redundant with the content of the following
-- lines. The following lines have the "key=value" format.
--
-- Note: when kernel event sockets are used with a classic Linux distribution
-- using udev, libudev injects its own events with their own syntax to perform
-- netlink communication between processes (expected to be replaced with kdbus
-- at some point). Hence we discard these events (they all begin with "libudev"
-- characters) and return Nothing.
