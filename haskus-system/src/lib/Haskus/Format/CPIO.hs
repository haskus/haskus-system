{- We only consider the "new" CPIO format because the old ones are deprecated.
 - From the man page: http://people.freebsd.org/~kientzle/libarchive/man/cpio.5.txt
 -
 -   The cpio archive format collects any number of files, directories, and
 -   other file system objects (symbolic links, device nodes, etc.) into a
 -   single stream of bytes.
 -
 - General Format
 -   Each file system object in a cpio archive comprises a header record with
 -   basic numeric metadata followed by the full pathname of the entry and the
 -   file data.  The header record stores a series of integer values that gen-
 -   erally follow the fields in struct stat.  (See stat(2) for details.)  The
 -   variants differ primarily in how they store those integers (binary,
 -   octal, or hexadecimal).  The header is followed by the pathname of the
 -   entry (the length of the pathname is stored in the header) and any file
 -   data.  The end of the archive is indicated by a special record with the
 -   pathname ``TRAILER!!!''.
 -
 -  [..]
 -
 - New ASCII Format
 -   The "new" ASCII format uses 8-byte hexadecimal fields for all numbers and
 -   separates device numbers into separate fields for major and minor num-
 -   bers.
 - 
 -    struct cpio_newc_header {
 - 	   char    c_magic[6];
 - 	   char    c_ino[8];
 - 	   char    c_mode[8];
 - 	   char    c_uid[8];
 - 	   char    c_gid[8];
 - 	   char    c_nlink[8];
 - 	   char    c_mtime[8];
 - 	   char    c_filesize[8];
 - 	   char    c_devmajor[8];
 - 	   char    c_devminor[8];
 - 	   char    c_rdevmajor[8];
 - 	   char    c_rdevminor[8];
 - 	   char    c_namesize[8];
 - 	   char    c_check[8];
 -    };
 - 
 -   Except as specified below, the fields here match those specified for the
 -   old binary format above.
 - 
 -   magic   The string ``070701''.
 - 
 -   check   This field is always set to zero by writers and ignored by read-
 -      ers.  See the next section for more details.
 -
 -   namesize Size of the file path (includes the trailing NUL byte)
 - 
 -   The pathname is followed by NUL bytes so that the total size of the fixed
 -   header plus pathname is a multiple of four.  Likewise, the file data is
 -   padded to a multiple of four bytes.  Note that this format supports only
 -   4 gigabyte files (unlike the older ASCII format, which supports 8 giga-
 -   byte files).
 - 
 -   In this format, hardlinked files are handled by setting the filesize to
 -   zero for each entry except the last one that appears in the archive.
 - 
 - New CRC Format
 -   The CRC format is identical to the new ASCII format described in the pre-
 -   vious section except that the magic field is set to ``070702'' and the
 -   check field is set to the sum of all bytes in the file data.  This sum is
 -   computed treating all bytes as unsigned values and using unsigned arith-
 -   metic.  Only the least-significant 32 bits of the sum are stored.

-- | File description
--
-- * fileDevMajor, fileDevMinor, fileDevInode: The device and inode numbers from
-- the disk. These are used by programs that read cpio archives to determine
-- when two entries refer to the same file. Programs that synthesize cpio
-- archives should be careful to set these to distinct values for each entry. 
--
-- * fileRDevMajor, fileRDevMinor: For block special and character special
-- entries, this field contains the associated device number.  For all other
-- entry types, it should be set to zero by writers and ignored by readers.
--
-- * fileModifTime: Modification time of the file, indicated as the number of
-- seconds since the start of the epoch, 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970.
